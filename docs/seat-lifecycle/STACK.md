# seat-lifecycle: stack

## Purpose

Decide how Slack seats work after the 2026-11-06 incident: when a seat starts, speaks and retires; how it journals; how a task resumes from journals; and how Tony controls seats (pause, Remote Control) from the fleet dashboard.

Procedure, from dfs-interview § Work the stack:

1. Run `stack.py <folder> current` for the top topic. Ask only its own questions.
2. Dispatch read-only subagents to survey what already exists for the topic.
3. Record each difference between the survey and the user's description.
4. Ask the user about each difference with an unclear answer.
5. Put one question per message to the user, or a small set of closely related questions. Give your recommendation with it.
6. Queue the other questions with `stack.py <folder> ask`.
7. Match each answer to the message it replies to. Ask when a reply could answer more than one message.
8. Record each answer in the topic's `README.md`. Copy the user's words from `quote.py`.
9. Write the result as the current design.
10. Tick each answered question with `stack.py <folder> answer`.
11. Run `stack.py <folder> close` when the topic's question queue is empty.
12. Commit.
13. Compact only when the closed topic ran long, with many exchanges or large reads. After a short topic, present the next topic in the same turn.
14. To compact, run `reflection(verb="compact", args={followup:...})`. Write a followup that invokes `dfs-interview` by name. Name the discussion folder, the closed topic, its commit and the new top topic in it.

## Current topic

**seat-brief**. Its result: `seat-brief/README.md`.

## Stack

- **unpause** (2026-11-06): can we pause and shutdown seats on altiar?
- **seat-brief** (2026-11-06): need to consolidate previous decsions into brief for seats on altair. need to also have a more general version for other seats like discord
  - [ ] Two layers composed by the routine? Recommend: a general seat SOP for every platform (lifecycle, journaling, speak rule, trust levels, first contact, reaching Tony) plus one deployment brief per server (Slack Hallam lab on altair: clusters, tools, tether, voice; Discord servers their own), both in agentic-commons docs. The routine adds the seat facts: person or channel, trust level, scope, queued messages, previous-agent note.
