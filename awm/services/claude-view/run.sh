#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run.sh — self-contained entry point for the claude-view service.
#
# The gateway discovers this service by scanning awm/services/* for run.sh, and
# starts (and respawns) it by executing `bash run.sh`, injecting AWM_HUB_URL /
# AWM_SERVICE_NAME / AWM_SERVICE_ID into the environment. The adapter reads
# those, POSTs /hub/service/register, and holds the control WS open. No auth.
#
# This service owns TWO things the gateway registration does not carry:
#   - the upstream claude-view server, a foreign Rust binary spawned as a child
#     (loopback-only, no auth of its own), and
#   - an HTTPS front on the mesh that reverse-proxies to it behind awm's edge
#     auth, reusing awm.httpsfront wholesale.
# Both die with this process, so the gateway's supervision covers all of it —
# same one-supervised-lifetime shape as `httpsfront` and `mic`.
#
# Two launch modes, branched on the dev signal DEV_PYTHONPATH:
#   - dev sandbox (DEV_PYTHONPATH set): run the uninstalled worktree code via
#     `mamba run`, resolving imports through the sandbox's PYTHONPATH dist-roots
#     — no install required.
#   - prod (installed): source ./.runtime-env (written by install.sh) for
#     AWM_PYTHON = the target env's absolute interpreter, so the supervisor can
#     respawn us under systemd's minimal PATH (no `mamba`).
