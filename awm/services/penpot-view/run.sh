# run.sh — self-contained entry point for the penpot-view service.
#
# The gateway discovers this service by scanning awm/services/* for run.sh, and
# starts (and respawns) it by executing `bash run.sh`, injecting AWM_HUB_URL /
# AWM_SERVICE_NAME / AWM_SERVICE_ID into the environment. awm.penpot_view.service
# reads those (via ServiceAdapter), registers the control WS at /svc/penpot-view,
# and — from its on_start — a second, separate registration: a kind=url mount at
# /penpot-view fronting the loopback render listener (see awm.penpot_view.mount).
# One process, two gateway registrations, exactly like drawio's split between its
# service control WS and its static/view mounts — except this service ships no
# static web-client tree, so there is only the one mount to hold.
#
# Two launch modes, branched on the dev signal DEV_PYTHONPATH:
#   - dev sandbox (DEV_PYTHONPATH set): run the uninstalled worktree code via
#     `mamba run`, resolving imports through the sandbox's PYTHONPATH dist-roots
#     — no install required.
#   - prod (installed): source ./.runtime-env (written by install.sh) for
#     AWM_PYTHON = the target env's absolute interpreter, so the supervisor can
#     respawn us under systemd's minimal PATH (no `mamba`).
