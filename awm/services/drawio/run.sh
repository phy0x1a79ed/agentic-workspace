#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run.sh — self-contained entry point for the drawio service.
#
# The gateway discovers this service by scanning awm/services/* for run.sh, and
# starts (and respawns) it by executing `bash run.sh`, injecting AWM_HUB_URL /
# AWM_SERVICE_NAME / AWM_SERVICE_ID into the environment. The adapter reads
# those, registers, and holds the control WS open. No auth.
#
# Two registrations, one process: the control WS (kind=service at /svc/drawio)
# carries the verbs and buys supervision; a separate kind=static mount at
# /drawio-app serves the drawio web client's ~150 MB of assets and runs its own
# lease/reconnect loop (see awm.drawio.mount).
#
# Two launch modes, branched on the dev signal DEV_PYTHONPATH:
#   - dev sandbox (DEV_PYTHONPATH set): run the uninstalled worktree code via
#     `mamba run`, resolving imports through the sandbox's PYTHONPATH dist-roots
#     — no install required.
#   - prod (installed): source ./.runtime-env (written by install.sh) for
#     AWM_PYTHON = the target env's absolute interpreter, so the supervisor can
#     respawn us under systemd's minimal PATH (no `mamba`).
